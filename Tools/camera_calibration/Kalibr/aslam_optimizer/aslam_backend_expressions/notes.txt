PTF, April 27, 2012: As far as I can see, the only way to get templated functions for 

template<typename Derived>
void ExpressionNode::evaluateJacobian(JacobianContainer J, const Eigen::MatrixBase<Derived> & applyChainRule) 

is to implement all expression nodes in one class and use a switch statement in "evaluate()" and in "evaluateJacobian()"

The switch is equivalent to the virtual function call but it will allow us to have templated functions. Not ideal but it should allow fixed-sized matrices.
