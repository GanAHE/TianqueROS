abstract ={                 This article presents GraphSLAM, a unifying algorithm for the offline SLAM                     problem. GraphSLAM is closely related to a recent sequence of research papers on                     applying optimization techniques to SLAM problems. It transforms the SLAM                     posterior into a graphical network, representing the log-likelihood of the data.                     It then reduces this graph using variable elimination techniques, arriving at a                     lower-dimensional problems that is then solved using conventional optimization                     techniques. As a result, GraphSLAM can generate maps with 108 or more                     features. The paper discusses a greedy algorithm for data association, and                     presents results for SLAM in urban environments with occasional GPS measurements.             },

abstract={The particle filter (PF) was introduced in 1993 as a numerical approximation to the nonlinear Bayesian filtering problem, and there is today a rather mature theory as well as a number of successful applications described in literature. This tutorial serves two purposes: to survey the part of the theory that is most important for applications and to survey a number of illustrative positioning applications from which conclusions relevant for the theory can be drawn. The theory part first surveys the nonlinear filtering problem and then describes the general PF algorithm in relation to classical solutions based on the extended Kalman filter (EKF) and the point mass filter (PMF). Tuning options, design alternatives, and user guidelines are described, and potential computational bottlenecks are identified and remedies suggested. Finally, the marginalized (or Rao-Blackwellized) PF is overviewed as a general framework for applying the PF to complex systems. The application part is more or less a stand-alone tutorial without equations that does not require any background knowledge in statistics or nonlinear filtering. It describes a number of related positioning applications where geographical information systems provide a nonlinear measurement and where it should be obvious that classical approaches based on Kalman filters (KFs) would have poor performance. All applications are based on real data and several of them come from real-time implementations. This part also provides complete code examples.},

Toward this goal he develops a description of uncertain geometric features as families of parametrized functions together with a distribution function defined on the associated parameter vector. Uncertain points, curves, and surfaces are considered, and it is shown how they can be manipulated and transformed between coordinate frames in an efficient and consistent manner. The effectiveness of these techniques is demonstrated by application to the problem of developing maximal-information sensing strategies},

abstract ={
               This paper proposes an approach to calibrate off-the-shelf cameras and inertial sensors to have a useful integrated system to be used in static and dynamic situations. When both sensors are integrated in a system their relative pose needs to be determined. The rotation between the camera and the inertial sensor can be estimated, concurrently with camera calibration, by having both sensors observe the vertical direction in several poses. The camera relies on a vertical chequered planar target and the inertial sensor on gravity to obtain a vertical reference. Depending on the setup and system motion, the translation between the two sensors can also be important. Using a simple passive turntable and static images, the translation can be estimated. The system needs to be placed in several poses and adjusted to turn about the inertial sensor centre, so that the lever arm to the camera can be determined. Simulation and real data results are presented to show the validity and simple requirements of the proposed methods.

               We describe a model to estimate motion from monocular visual and inertial measurements. We analyze the model and characterize the conditions under which its state is observable, and its parameters are identifiable. These include the unknown gravity vector, and the unknown transformation between the camera coordinate frame and the inertial unit. We show that it is possible to estimate both state and parameters as part of an on-line procedure, but only provided that the motion sequence is ‘rich enough’, a condition that we characterize explicitly. We then describe an efficient implementation of a filter to estimate the state and parameters of this model, including gravity and camera-to-inertial calibration. It runs in real-time on an embedded platform. We report experiments of continuous operation, without failures, re-initialization, or re-calibration, on paths of length up to 30 km. We also describe an integrated approach to ‘loop-closure’, that is the recognition of previously seen locations and the topological re-adjustment of the traveled path. It represents visual features relative to the global orientation reference provided by the gravity vector estimated by the filter, and relative to the scale provided by their known position within the map; these features are organized into ‘locations’ defined by visibility constraints, represented in a topological graph, where loop-closure can be performed without the need to re-compute past trajectories or perform bundle adjustment. The software infrastructure as well as the embedded platform is described in detail in a previous technical report.

We propose a new algorithm for estimating the relative translation and orientation, which does not require any additional hardware, except a piece of paper with a checkerboard pattern on it. The method is based on a physical model which can also be used in solving, for example, sensor fusion problems.

abstract={This paper presents a tracking system for ego-motion estimation which fuses vision and inertial measurements using EKF and UKF (Extended and Unscented Kalman Filters), where a comparison of their performance has been done. It also considers the multi-rate nature of the sensors: inertial sensing is sampled at a fast sampling frequency while the sampling frequency of vision is lower. the proposed approach uses a constant linear acceleration model and constant angular velocity model based on quaternions, which yields a non-linear model for states and a linear model in measurement equations. Results show that a significant improvement is obtained on the estimation when fusing both measurements with respect to just vision or just inertial measurements. It is also shown that the proposed system can estimate fast-motions even when vision system fails. Moreover, a study of the influence of the noise covariance is also performed, which aims to select their appropriate values at the tuning process. The setup is an end-effector mounted camera, which allow us to pre-define basic rotational and translational motions for validating results.},

abstract ={ Visual and inertial sensors, in combination, are able to provide accurate motion estimates and are well suited for use in many robot navigation tasks. However, correct data fusion, and hence overall performance, depends on careful calibration of the rigid body transform between the sensors. Obtaining this calibration information is typically difficult and time-consuming, and normally requires additional equipment. In this paper we describe an algorithm, based on the unscented Kalman filter, for self-calibration of the transform between a camera and an inertial measurement unit (IMU). Our formulation rests on a differential geometric analysis of the observability of the camera—IMU system; this analysis shows that the sensor-to-sensor transform, the IMU gyroscope and accelerometer biases, the local gravity vector, and the metric scene structure can be recovered from camera and IMU measurements alone. While calibrating the transform we simultaneously localize the IMU and build a map of the surroundings, all without additional hardware or prior knowledge about the environment in which a robot is operating. We present results from simulation studies and from experiments with a monocular camera and a low-cost IMU, which demonstrate accurate estimation of both the calibration parameters and the local scene structure.},

abstract={Vision-aided inertial navigation systems (V-INSs) can provide precise state estimates for the 3-D motion of a vehicle when no external references (e.g., GPS) are available. This is achieved by combining inertial measurements from an inertial measurement unit (IMU) with visual observations from a camera under the assumption that the rigid transformation between the two sensors is known. Errors in the IMU-camera extrinsic calibration process cause biases that reduce the estimation accuracy and can even lead to divergence of any estimator processing the measurements from both sensors. In this paper, we present an extended Kalman filter for precisely determining the unknown transformation between a camera and an IMU. Contrary to previous approaches, we explicitly account for the time correlation of the IMU measurements and provide a figure of merit (covariance) for the estimated transformation. The proposed method does not require any special hardware (such as spin table or 3-D laser scanner) except a calibration target. Furthermore, we employ the observability rank criterion based on Lie derivatives and prove that the nonlinear system describing the IMU-camera calibration process is observable. Simulation and experimental results are presented that validate the proposed method and quantify its accuracy.},

	Abstract = {This article presents a method for rectifying and stabilising video from cell-phones with rolling shutter (RS) cameras. Due to size constraints, cell-phone cameras have constant, or near constant focal length, making them an ideal application for calibrated projective geometry. In contrast to previous RS rectification attempts that model distortions in the image plane, we model the 3D rotation of the camera. We parameterise the camera rotation as a continuous curve, with knots distributed across a short frame interval. Curve parameters are found using non-linear least squares over inter-frame correspondences from a KLT tracker. By smoothing a sequence of reference rotations from the estimated curve, we can at a small extra cost, obtain a high-quality image stabilisation. Using synthetic RS sequences with associated ground-truth, we demonstrate that our rectification improves over two other methods. We also compare our video stabilisation with the methods in iMovie and Deshaker.},

title={A hybrid SLAM representation for dynamic marine environments},

pages={257--264}, 
abstract={We present a hybrid SLAM system for marine environments that combines cubic splines to represent the trajectories of dynamic objects, point features to represent stationary objects and an occupancy grid to represent land masses. This hybrid representation enables SLAM to be applied in environments with moving objects, where solutions using point features alone are computationally prohibitive or where dense objects e.g. landmasses can not be represented correctly using point features. Estimation is achieved using a sliding window framework with reversible data-association and reversible model-selection. Our main contributions are: (i) a hybrid representation of the environment; (ii) occupancy grid fusion is continually refined for the duration of the sliding window; (iii) the trajectories of dynamic objects are represented using cubic splines and (iv) radar scans are re-rendered at a sub-scan resolution to compensate for the egomotion during the scan acquisition period. We show that the continual refinement of the occupancy grid greatly improves the quality of the resultant map, leading to a better estimate of the egomotion and therefore better estimates of the trajectories of dynamic objects. We also demonstrate that the use of cubic splines to represent trajectories has two major advantages: (i) the state space is compressed i.e. many vehicle poses can be represented using a single spline section and (ii) the trajectory becomes continuous and so fusing information from asynchronous sensors running at multiple frequencies becomes trivial. The efficacy of our system is demonstrated using real marine radar data, showing that it can successfully estimate the positions/velocities of objects and landmasses observed during a typical voyage on a small boat.},

@incollection{Thrun0800,
	Abstract = {This chapter provides a comprehensive introduction in to the simultaneous localization and mapping problem, better known in its abbreviated form as SLAM. SLAM addresses the problem of a robot navigating an unknown environment. While navigating the environment, the robot seeks to acquire a map thereof, and at the same time it wishes to localize itself using its map. The use of SLAM problems can be motivated in two different ways: one might be interested in detailed environment models, or one might seek to maintain an accurate sense of a mobile robotʼs location. SLAM serves both of these purposes.    We review three major paradigms of algorithms from which a huge number of recently published methods are derived. First comes the traditional approach, which relies on the extended Kalman filter (EKF)    for representing the robotʼs best estimate. The second paradigm draws its intuition from the fact that the SLAM problem can be viewed as a sparse graph of constraints, and it applies nonlinear optimization for recovering the map and the robotʼs locations. Finally, we survey the particle filter paradigm, which applies nonparametric density estimation and efficient factorization methods to the SLAM problem. This chapter discusses extensions of these basic methods. It elucidates variants of the SLAM problem and proposes a taxonomy for the field. Relevant research is referenced extensively, and open research problems are discussed.},

	Abstract = {The martian subsurface has been probed to kilometer depths by the Mars Advanced Radar for Subsurface and Ionospheric Sounding instrument aboard the Mars Express orbiter. Signals penetrate the polar layered deposits, probably imaging the base of the deposits. Data from the northern lowlands of Chryse Planitia have revealed a shallowly buried quasi-circular structure about 250 kilometers in diameter that is interpreted to be an impact basin. In addition, a planar reflector associated with the basin structure may indicate the presence of a low-loss deposit that is more than 1 kilometer thick.

@article{Seu0700,
	Abstract = {SHARAD (SHAllow RADar) is a sounding radar provided by Agenzia Spaziale Italiana (ASI) as a Facility Instrument on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter mission. Its 20-MHz center frequency and 10-MHz bandwidth complement the lower-frequency, relatively narrower bandwidth capability of the MARSIS sounding radar. A joint Italian-U.S. team has guided the experiment development and is responsible for data analysis and interpretation. The radar transmits signals at a 700 Hz pulse repetition frequency (PRF) and collects reflections from both the surface and near subsurface of Mars. Vertical and horizontal resolutions are, respectively, 15 m (free-space) and 3--6 km (cross-track) by 0.3--1 km (along-track). The scientific objective of SHARAD is to map, in selected locales, dielectric interfaces to at least several hundred meters depth in the Martian subsurface and to interpret these results in terms of the occurrence and distribution of expected materials, including competent rock, soil, water, and ice. A signal-to-noise ratio of ∼50 dB (for a specular surface return) is achieved with 10 W of radiated power by using range and azimuth focusing in ground data processing. Preprocessed data as well as range- and azimuth-focused data will be formatted according to Planetary Data System (PDS) standards and be made available from the ASI Science Data Center (ASDC) and from the Geosciences Node of the Planetary Data System (PDS). Important targets for SHARAD include the polar layered deposits, sedimentary stacks (especially in Terra Meridiani), buried channel systems, buried impact craters, volcanic complexes, and shallow ice deposits in equilibrium with the atmosphere.},

	Abstract = { A study on the electromagnetic propagation in various models of the
	Martian subsurface is performed with a relevance to ground penetrating
	radar (GPR) operating onboard rover missions. Measurements of the
	electromagnetic properties of Mars soil simulants are obtained; on
	this basis, the attenuation features of the GPR signals are estimated,
	including both electric and magnetic losses. The effect on propagation
	of inhomogeneities inside the soil is also taken into account by
	means of a specific model with randomly distributed scatterers. The
	GPR performance in terms of resolution and maximum penetration depth
	is evaluated in the considered scenarios for different operating
	frequencies, thus providing a basic information for the design of
	systems for future subsurface sounding investigations on Mars. },

	Abstract = { Using ground-penetrating radars to investigate the subsurface of
	Mars will be a key scientific objective over the next several years,
	especially in light of the large possibility that water could exist
	within the planet. Radars operating from a few megahertz up to a
	gigahertz will be able to provide valuable information concerning
	the subsurface electrical structure at resolutions ranging from a
	few centimeters near the surface to a few tens of meters at greater
	depths. One of the major goals of the work presented was to develop
	a lightweight, low-power, frequency-modulated radar system that could
	be used to detect subsurface deposits of ice and water. An inexpensive
	prototype system was developed using off-the-shelf connectorized
	components and evaluation boards. To verify the operation of this
	prototype system, a preliminary experiment was conducted in Lawrence,
	Kansas. Next, experiments were conducted over locations containing
	permafrost and ice in Fairbanks, Alaska. Results from these experiments
	are presented.},

	Abstract = { Under NASA instrument development programs (PIDDP 2000-2002, MIDP
	2003-2005, ESR&T, 2005), we have been developing miniature ground
	penetrating radars (GPR) for use in mapping subsurface stratigraphy
	from planetary rovers for Mars and lunar applications. The Mars GPR
	is for deeper penetration (up to 50-m depth) into the Martian subsurface
	at moderate resolution (1.5 m) for a geological characterization.
	As a part of the CRUX (construction & resource utilization explorer)
	instrument suite, the CRUX GPR is optimized for a lunar prospecting
	application. It will have shallower penetration (5-m depth) with
	higher resolution (15 cm) for construction operations including ISRU
	(in-situ resource utilization). The GPR is a short-pulse type system,
	which responds to interfaces between materials of differing dielectric
	permittivity. Currently, the CRUX GPR (technology readiness level
	4) has miniaturized radar electronics (2 boards, 10 cm /spl times/
	5 cm /spl times/ 2 cm, 1 W power, total 45 g), with 2 batteries (9
	V, 2 /spl times/ 45 g) operating at 800-MHz center frequency. Field
	testing of the prototype has been conducted extensively. When deployed
	for lunar missions, the CRUX GPR data will help prospecting possible
	construction sites.},

	Abstract = {Design and testing of an impulse ground-penetrating radar (GPR) for
	possible rover deployment on Mars in 2009 is well underway. The GPR
	has mass, power, volume, and data-rate targets of 0.5 kg, 3 W (peak),
	3400 cm3, and 0.3 Mb/d and will possess easily modified bistatic
	high-frequency (e.g., 500--600 MHz) and monostatic ``rat-tail'' (e.g.,
	100 MHz) antennas. The GPR should be capable of measuring in situ
	radar properties on Mars to depths of up to 10--20 m, thereby helping
	to constrain near-surface geology and structure. Initial GPR tests
	at the site of the 2001 FIDO rover field trials near Cronese Lake,
	California, confirm the value of the instrument in defining local
	geologic setting and in providing context for data collected using
	other rover science payload elements. A rover-deployed GPR may enable
	three-dimensional mapping of local stratigraphy, which in turn can
	assist in evaluating the history of aqueous activity and the accessibility
	of near-surface water.},

	Abstract = { NASA's Mars exploration rovers' (MER) onboard mobility flight software
	was designed to provide robust and flexible operation. The MER vehicles
	can be commanded directly, or given autonomous control over multiple
	aspects of mobility: which motions to drive, measurement of actual
	motion, terrain interpretation, even the selection of targets of
	interest (although this mode remains largely underused). Vehicle
	motion can be commanded using multiple layers of control: motor control,
	direct drive operations (arc, turn in place), and goal-based driving
	(goto waypoint). Multiple layers of safety checks ensure vehicle
	performance: command limits (command timeout, time of day limit,
	software enable, activity constraints), reactive checks (e.g., motor
	current limit, vehicle tilt limit), and predictive checks (e.g.,
	step, tilt, roughness hazards). From January 2004 through October
	2005, Spirit accumulated over 5000 meters and Opportunity 6000 meters
	of odometry, often covering more than 100 meters in a single day.
	In this paper we describe the software that has driven these rovers
	more than a combined 11,000 meters over the Martian surface, including
	its design and implementation, and summarize current mobility performance
	results from Mars.},

	Abstract = {Abstract~~Mobile robot vision-based navigation has been the source
	of countless research contributions, from the domains of both vision
	and control. Vision is becoming more and more common in applications
	such as localization, automatic map construction, autonomous navigation,
	path following, inspection, monitoring or risky situation detection.
	This survey presents those pieces of work, from the nineties until
	nowadays, which constitute a wide progress in visual navigation techniques
	for land, aerial and autonomous underwater vehicles. The paper deals
	with two major approaches: map-based navigation and mapless navigation.
	Map-based navigation has been in turn subdivided in metric map-based
	navigation and topological map-based navigation. Our outline to mapless
	navigation includes reactive techniques based on qualitative characteristics
	extraction, appearance-based localization, optical flow, features
	tracking, plane ground detection/tracking, etc... The recent concept
	of visual sonar has also been revised. },

	Abstract = {Vision systems are used more and more in 'personal' robots interacting
	with humans, since semantic information about objects and places
	can be derived from the rich sensory information. Visual information
	is also used for building appearance based topological maps, which
	can be used for localization. In this paper we describe a system
	capable of using this appearance based topological map for navigation.
	The system is made robust by using the epipolar geometry and a planar
	floor constraint in computing the necessary heading information.
	Using this method the robot is able to drive robustly in a large
	environment. We tested the method on real data under varying environment
	conditions and compared performance with a human-controlled robot.},

	Abstract = {In this paper we describe Atlas, a hybrid metrical/topological approach
	to simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) that achieves efficient
	mapping of large-scale environments. The representation is a graph
	of coordinate frames, with each vertex in the graph representing
	a local frame and each edge representing the transformation between
	adjacent frames. In each frame, we build a map that captures the
	local environment and the current robot pose along with the uncertainties
	of each. Each map's uncertainties are modeled with respect to its
	own frame. Probabilities of entities with respect to arbitrary frames
	are generated by following a path formed by the edges between adjacent
	frames, computed using either the Dijkstra shortest path algorithm
	or breath-first search. Loop closing is achieved via an efficient
	map-matching algorithm coupled with a cycle verification step. We
	demonstrate the performance of the technique for post-processing
	large data sets, including an indoor structured environment (2.2
	km path length) with multiple nested loops using laser or ultrasonic
	ranging sensors.},

@article{Courbon0801,
	Abstract = {Abstract~~When navigating in an unknown environment for the first
	time, a natural behavior consists on memorizing some key views along
	the performed path, in order to use these references as checkpoints
	for a future navigation mission. The navigation framework for wheeled
	mobile robots presented in this paper is based on this assumption.
	During a human-guided learning step, the robot performs paths which
	are sampled and stored as a set of ordered key images, acquired by
	an embedded camera. The set of these obtained visual paths is topologically
	organized and provides a visual memory of the environment. Given
	an image of one of the visual paths as a target, the robot navigation
	mission is defined as a concatenation of visual path subsets, called
	visual route. When running autonomously, the robot is controlled
	by a visual servoing law adapted to its nonholonomic constraint.
	Based on the regulation of successive homographies, this control
	guides the robot along the reference visual route without explicitly
	planning any trajectory. The proposed framework has been designed
	for the entire class of central catadioptric cameras (including conventional
	cameras). It has been validated onto two architectures. In the first
	one, algorithms have been implemented onto a dedicated hardware and
	the robot is equipped with a standard perspective camera. In the
	second one, they have been implemented on a standard PC and an omnidirectional
	camera is considered. },

	Abstract = {This paper describes a probabilistic approach to the problem of recognizing
	places based on their appearance. The system we present is not limited
	to localization, but can determine that a new observation comes from
	a previously unseen place, and so augment its map. Effectively this
	is a SLAM system in the space of appearance. Our probabilistic approach
	allows us to explicitly account for perceptual aliasing in the environment--identical
	but indistinctive observations receive a low probability of having
	come from the same place. We achieve this by learning a generative
	model of place appearance. By partitioning the learning problem into
	two parts, new place models can be learned online from only a single
	observation of a place. The algorithm complexity is linear in the
	number of places in the map, and is particularly suitable for online
	loop closure detection in mobile robotics.},

	Abstract = { Vision sensors are attractive for autonomous robots because they
	are a rich source of environment information. The main challenge
	in using images for mobile robots is managing this wealth of information.
	A relatively recent approach is the use of fast wide baseline local
	features, which we developed and used in the novel approach to sparse
	visual path following described in this paper. These local features
	have the great advantage that they can be recognized even if the
	viewpoint differs significantly. This opens the door to a memory
	efficient description of a path by descriptors of sparse images.
	We propose a method for re-execution of these paths by a series of
	visual homing operations which yield a navigation method with unique
	properties: it is accurate, robust, fast, and without odometry error

	Abstract = {Abstract~~In this work we present a novel system for autonomous mobile
	robot navigation. With only an omnidirectional camera as sensor,
	this system is able to build automatically and robustly accurate
	topologically organised environment maps of a complex, natural environment.
	It can localise itself using such a map at each moment, including
	both at startup (kidnapped robot) or using knowledge of former localisations.
	The topological nature of the map is similar to the intuitive maps
	humans use, is memory-efficient and enables fast and simple path
	planning towards a specified goal. We developed a real-time visual
	servoing technique to steer the system along the computed path. A
	key technology making this all possible is the novel fast wide baseline
	feature matching, which yields an efficient description of the scene,
	with a focus on man-made environments. },

	trajectories. Appearance is captured as a set of low-resolution images.
	Energy normalised cross correlation is used to maintain heading,
	to estimate confidence and to servo control a robot vehicle while
	following a path. Experimental results are presented which compare
	results with a single camera, a pair of parallel cameras and a pair
	of divergent cameras. The most accurate (and robust) navigation is
	found with a pair of cameras which are slightly divergent},

	Abstract = {Many successful indoor mapping techniques employ frame-to-frame matching
	of laser scans to produce detailed local maps as well as the closing
	of large loops. In this paper, we propose a framework for applying
	the same techniques to visual imagery. We match visual frames with
	large numbers of point features, using classic bundle adjustment
	techniques from computational vision, but we keep only relative frame
	pose information (a skeleton). The skeleton is a reduced nonlinear
	system that is a faithful approximation of the larger system and
	can be used to solve large loop closures quickly, as well as forming
	a backbone for data association and local registration. We illustrate
	the workings of the system with large outdoor datasets (10 km), showing
	large-scale loop closure and precise localization in real time.},

@article{Lowe0401,
	Abstract = {This paper presents a method for extracting distinctive invariant
	features from images that can be used to perform reliable matching
	between different views of an object or scene. The features are invariant
	to image scale and rotation, and are shown to provide robust matching
	across a substantial range of affine distortion, change in 3D viewpoint,
	addition of noise, and change in illumination. The features are highly
	distinctive, in the sense that a single feature can be correctly
	matched with high probability against a large database of features
	from many images. This paper also describes an approach to using
	these features for object recognition. The recognition proceeds by
	matching individual features to a database of features from known
	objects using a fast nearest-neighbor algorithm, followed by a Hough
	transform to identify clusters belonging to a single object, and
	finally performing verification through least-squares solution for
	consistent pose parameters. This approach to recognition can robustly
	identify objects among clutter and occlusion while achieving near
	real-time performance.},

@incollection{Maimone0601,
	Abstract = {In January, 2004, the Mars Exploration Rover (MER) mission landed
	two rovers, Spirit and Opportunity, on the surface of Mars. Several
	autonomous navigation capabilities were employed in space for the
	first time in this mission. In the Entry, Descent, and Landing (EDL)
	phase, both landers used a vision system called the Descent Image
	Motion Estimation System (DIMES) to estimate horizontal velocity
	during the last 2000 meters (m) of descent, by tracking features
	on the ground with a downlooking camera, in order to control retro-rocket
	firing to reduce horizontal velocity before impact. During surface
	operations, the rovers navigate autonomously using stereo vision
	for local terrain mapping and a local, reactive planning algorithm
	called Grid-based Estimation of Surface Traversability Applied to
	Local Terrain (GESTALT) for obstacle avoidance. In areas of high
	slip, stereo visionbased visual odometry has been used to estimate
	rover motion. As of mid-June, Spirit had traversed 3405 m, of which
	1253 m were done autonomously; Opportunity had traversed 1264 m,
	of which 224 m were autonomous. These results have contributed substantially
	to the success of the mission and paved the way for increased levels
	of autonomy in future missions.},

@article{Milford0900,
	Abstract = {The challenge of persistent navigation and mapping is to develop an
	autonomous robot system that can simultaneously localize, map and
	navigate over the lifetime of the robot with little or no human intervention.
	Most solutions to the simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM)
	problem aim to produce highly accurate maps of areas that are assumed
	to be static. In contrast, solutions for persistent navigation and
	mapping must produce reliable goal-directed navigation outcomes in
	an environment that is assumed to be in constant flux. We investigate
	the persistent navigation and mapping problem in the context of an
	autonomous robot that performs mock deliveries in a working office
	environment over a two-week period. The solution was based on the
	biologically inspired visual SLAM system, RatSLAM. RatSLAM performed
	SLAM continuously while interacting with global and local navigation
	systems, and a task selection module that selected between exploration,
	delivery, and recharging modes. The robot performed 1,143 delivery
	tasks to 11 different locations with only one delivery failure (from
	which it recovered), traveled a total distance of more than 40 km
	over 37 hours of active operation, and recharged autonomously a total
	of 23 times. 10.1177/0278364909340592},

	Abstract = {6D SLAM simultaneous localization and mapping or 6D concurrent localization
	and
	
	mapping of mobile robots considers six dimensions for the robot pose,
	namely, the x, y,
	
	and z coordinates and the roll, yaw, and pitch angles. Robot motion
	and localization on
	
	natural surfaces, e.g., driving outdoor with a mobile robot, must
	regard these degrees of
	
	freedom. This paper presents a robotic mapping method based on locally
	consistent 3D
	
	laser range scans. Iterative Closest Point scan matching, combined
	with a heuristic for
	
	closed loop detection and a global relaxation method, results in a
	highly precise mapping
	
	system. A new strategy for fast data association, cached kd-tree search,
	leads to feasible
	
	computing times. With no ground-truth data available for outdoor environments,
	point
	
	relations in maps are compared to numerical relations in uncalibrated
	aerial images in
	
	order to assess the metric validity of the resulting 3D maps},

	mobile robot with reference pre-recorded images, without any environment
	maps. The strategy of navigation in this research is that the differences
	of position and orientation of robot between the reference one and
	the present one are continuously estimated from true images, and
	are used in the locomotion control commands. In this paper, we use
	only vertical lines in the image as extracted features, and propose
	the method to calculate the estimated differences of position and
	orientation from two images. We also show some results of simulations
	and experiments using an actual mobile robot, and examine its reliability},

	Abstract = {The appearance-based approach in visual robot navigation applied to
	the following of pre-recorded routes supposes several advantages,
	such as its application to non-structured environments and the relatively
	simple extraction of control laws. The classical approaches consist
	on two separated phases: learning and navigation, so, one robot cannot
	start navigation until learning has finished, and if some locations
	have to be added once learning has finished, the database must be
	created from the scratch. This work presents how an incremental PCA
	model can be used to overcome these limitations. With this approach,
	the follower robot can start while the database is still being built.
	Comparing the current view with those in the database, it can localize
	and navigate using a fuzzy controller. This approach can be applied
	to collaborative tasks where a team of robots must follow a guide
	one or in vigilance tasks where a route in a building has to be repeated
	continuously. },

	localization and mapping (SLAM) that focuses computational resources
	on accurately estimating the immediate spatial surroundings using
	a sliding time window of the most recent sensor measurements. Ideally,
	we would like a constant time algorithm that closely approximates
	the all-time maximum-likelihood estimate as well as the minimum variance
	Cramer Rao lower bound (CRLB) - that is we would like an estimator
	that achieves some notion of statistical optimality (quickly converges),
	efficiency (quickly reduces uncertainty) and consistency (avoids
	over-confidence). To this end we give a derivation of the SLAM problem
	from the Gaussian non-linear least squares optimization perspective.We
	find that this results in a simple, yet general, take on the SLAM
	problem; we think this is a useful contribution.},

	system memorizes a sequence of environmental images and robot's poses
	during teaching stage. In the course of playback navigation, the
	system calculates the robot's position difference from the memorized

	Abstract = {Computer vision often involves estimating models from visual input.
	Sometimes it is possible to fit several different models or hypotheses
	to a set of data, and a decision must be made as to which is most
	appropriate. This paper explores ways of automating the model selection
	process with specific emphasis on the least squares problem of fitting
	manifolds (in particular algebraic varieties e.g. lines, algebraic
	curves, planes etc.) to data points, illustrated with respect to
	epipolar geometry. The approach is Bayesian and the contribution
	three fold, first a new Bayesian description of the problem is laid
	out that supersedes the author's previous maximum likelihood formulations,
	this formulation will reveal some hidden elements of the problem.
	Second an algorithm, `MAPSAC', is provided to obtain the robust MAP
	estimate of an arbitrary manifold. Third, a Bayesian model selection
	paradigm is proposed, the Bayesian formulation of the manifoldfitting
	problem uncovers an elegant solution to this problem, for which a
	new method `GRIC'for approximating the posterior probability of each
	putative model is derived. This approximations bears some similarity
	to the penalized likelihoods used by AIC, BIC and MDL however it
	is far more accurate in situations involving large numbers of latent
	variables whose number increases with the data. This will be empirically
	and theoretically demonstrated.},
