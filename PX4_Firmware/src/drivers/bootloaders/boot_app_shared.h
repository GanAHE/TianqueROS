 * Bootloader and Application shared structure.
 *
 * The data in this structure is passed in SRAM or the the CAN filter

 *
 * Do not assume any mapping or location for the passing of this data
 * that is done in the read and write routines and is abstracted by design.
 *
 * For reference, the following is performed based on eRole in API calls
 * defined below:
 *
 *      The application must write BOOTLOADER_COMMON_APP_SIGNATURE to the
 *      signature field when passing data to the bootloader; when the
 *      bootloader passes data to the application, it must write
 *      BOOTLOADER_COMMON_BOOTLOADER_SIGNATURE to the signature field.
 *
 *      The CRC is calculated over the structure from signature to the
 *      last byte. The resulting values are then copied to the CAN filter
 *      registers by bootloader_app_shared_read and
 *      bootloader_app_shared_write.

 *      5) The new image file is then written to a file a ".img" extension.

 * Name: bootloader_app_shared_read
 *
 * Description:
 *   Based on the role requested, this function will conditionally populate
 *   a bootloader_app_shared_t structure from the physical locations used
 *   to transfer the shared data to/from an application (internal data) .
 *
 *   The functions will only populate the structure and return a status
 *   indicating success, if the internal data has the correct signature as
 *   requested by the Role AND has a valid crc.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   shared - A pointer to a bootloader_app_shared_t return the data in if
 *   the internal data is valid for the requested Role
 *   role   - An eRole_t of App or BootLoader to validate the internal data
 *            against. For a Bootloader this would be the value of App to
 *            read the application passed data.
 *
 * Returned value:
 *   OK     - Indicates that the internal data has been copied to callers
 *            bootloader_app_shared_t structure.
 *
 *  -EBADR  - The Role or crc of the internal data was not valid. The copy
 *            did not occur.

 *
 *   The functions will populate the signature and crc the data

 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   shared - A pointer to a bootloader_app_shared_t data to commit to
 *   the internal data for passing to/from an application.
 *   role   - An eRole_t of App or BootLoader to use in the internal data
 *            to be passed to/from an application. For a Bootloader this
 *            would be the value of Bootloader to write to the passed data.
