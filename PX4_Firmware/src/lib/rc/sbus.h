 *
 * The minimum frame spacing is 7ms; with 25 bytes at 100000bps
 * frame transmission time is ~2ms.
 *
 * If an interval of more than 4ms (7 ms frame spacing plus margin)
 * passes between calls, the first byte we read will be the first
 * byte of a frame.
 *
 * In the case where byte(s) are dropped from a frame, this also
 * provides a degree of protection. Of course, it would be better
 * if we didn't drop bytes...
