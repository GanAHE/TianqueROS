        BAT${i}_V_EMPTY:
            description:
                short: Empty cell voltage (5C load)
                long: |
                    Defines the voltage where a single cell of battery 1 is considered empty.
                    The voltage should be chosen before the steep dropoff to 2.8V. A typical
                    lithium battery can only be discharged down to 10% before it drops off
                    to a voltage level damaging the cells.

        BAT${i}_V_CHARGED:
            description:
                short: Full cell voltage (5C load)
                long: |
                    Defines the voltage where a single cell of battery 1 is considered full
                    under a mild load. This will never be the nominal voltage of 4.2V

            description:
                short: Voltage drop per cell on full throttle
                long: |
                    This implicitely defines the internal resistance
                    to maximum current ratio for battery 1 and assumes linearity.
                    A good value to use is the difference between the
                    5C and 20-25C load. Not used if BAT${i}_R_INTERNAL is
                    set.

                    If non-negative, then this will be used in place of

                long: |
                    This parameter controls the source of battery data. The value 'Power Module'
                    means that measurements are expected to come from a power module. If the value is set to
                    'External' then the system expects to receive mavlink battery status messages.
                    If the value is set to 'ESCs', the battery information are taken from the esc_status message.
                    This requires the ESC to provide both voltage as well as current.
            type: enum
            values:
                0: Power Module
