 *     - Explicit control over frequency and damping
 *     - Explicit control over track capture angle
 *     - Ability to use loiter radius smaller than L1 length
 *     - Modified to use PD control for circle tracking to enable loiter radius less than L1 length
 *     - Modified to enable period and damping of guidance loop to be set explicitly
 *     - Modified to provide explicit control over capture angle
