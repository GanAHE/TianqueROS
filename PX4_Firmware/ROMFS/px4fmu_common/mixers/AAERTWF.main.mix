Aileron/rudder/elevator/throttle/wheel/flaps mixer for PX4FMU
=======================================================

This file defines mixers suitable for controlling a fixed wing aircraft with
aileron, rudder, elevator, throttle and steerable wheel controls using PX4FMU.
The configuration assumes the aileron servo(s) are connected to PX4FMU servo
output 0 and 1, the elevator to output 2, the rudder to output 3, the throttle
to output 4 and the wheel to output 5.

Inputs to the mixer come from channel group 0 (vehicle attitude), channels 0
(roll), 1 (pitch), 2 (yaw) and 3 (thrust) 4 (flaps).

Aileron mixer (roll + flaperon)
---------------------------------

This mixer assumes that the aileron servos are set up correctly mechanically;
depending on the actual configuration it may be necessary to reverse the scaling
factors (to reverse the servo movement) and adjust the offset, scaling and
endpoints to suit.

Elevator mixer
------------
Two scalers total (output, roll).

This mixer assumes that the elevator servo is set up correctly mechanically;
depending on the actual configuration it may be necessary to reverse the scaling
factors (to reverse the servo movement) and adjust the offset, scaling and
endpoints to suit.

Rudder mixer
------------
Two scalers total (output, yaw).

This mixer assumes that the rudder servo is set up correctly mechanically;
depending on the actual configuration it may be necessary to reverse the scaling
factors (to reverse the servo movement) and adjust the offset, scaling and
endpoints to suit.

Motor speed mixer
-----------------
Two scalers total (output, thrust).

This mixer generates a full-range output (-1 to 1) from an input in the (0 - 1)
range.  Inputs below zero are treated as zero.

Wheel mixer
------------
Two scalers total (output, yaw).

This mixer assumes that the wheel servo is set up correctly mechanically;
depending on the actual configuration it may be necessary to reverse the scaling
factors (to reverse the servo movement) and adjust the offset, scaling and
endpoints to suit.
