# DJI ESCs do not support calibration and need higher PWM_MIN
# http://www.dji.com/e2000/info indicates E2000 Operating Pulse Width: 1120 to 1920 Î¼s
# It seems that all latest DJI ESC have the same range.
# Note that the setting here applies to all PWM channels.
# param set PWM_MIN 1120
# param set PWM_MAX 1920
# Not using DJI 430 LITE ESC anymore due to its hiccups:
#    each random motor stop would cause a scary flip in the fly
# Replacing with 4 BLHeli32 (Wraith32 V2) ESCs solved the main problem in BBBlue porting

# Broadcast heartbeats on local network. This allows a ground control station
# to automatically find the drone on the local network.

# Three possible main power battery sources for BBBlue:
# 1. onboard 2S LiPo battery connector, which is connect to ADC channel 6
# 2. onboard 9-18V DC Jack, which is connect to ADC channel 5. This is the board default.
# 3. other power source (e.g., LiPo battery more than 4S/18V).
#    Scale the voltage to below 1.8V and connect it to ADC channel # 0, 1, 2 or 3.
param set BAT1_V_CHANNEL 	5

# Battery voltage scale factor, from BBBlue schematics: (4.7K + 47K) / 4.7K = 11
