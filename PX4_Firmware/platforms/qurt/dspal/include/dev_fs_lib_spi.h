/**
 * @file
 * The declarations in this file are released to DSPAL users and are used to
 * make file I/O call's for access to slave devices on a SPI bus.  Many of the
 * data structures are used in the parameter of the IOCTL functions to define the
 * behavior of the particular IOCTL.
 *
 * Sample source files are referenced to demonstrate how a particular IOCTL
 * or data structure is used in the context of the POSIX standard file I/O functions
 * (open/close/read/write/ioctl).
 *
 * @par Reading SPI Data
 * To read data that has accumulated since the last call to read (see the rx_func_ptr_t to define an
 * optional receive data callback) the buffer parameter of the read function must reference a buffer
 * large enough to contain all of the accumulated data.  If the buffer is not large enough, some portion of the
 * accumulated will be copied to the buffer.  The actual length of the data copied to the caller's buffer is
 * specified in the return value of the read function.
 *
 * @par Writing SPI Data
 * To write data to the SPI bus slave device a buffer parameter containing the data to be transmitted
 * must be passed to the write function.  After the data is queued for transmit, the write function will
 * return immediately to the caller.
 *
 * @par
 * Sample source code for read/write data to a SPI slave device is included below:
 * @include spi_test_imp.c
