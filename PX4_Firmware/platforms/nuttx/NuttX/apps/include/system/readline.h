 * Name: readline_prompt
 *
 *   If a prompt string is used by the application, then the application
 *   must provide the prompt string to readline() by calling this function.
 *   This is needed only for tab completion in cases where is it necessary
 *   to reprint the prompt string.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   prompt    - The prompt string. This function may then be
 *   called with that value in order to restore the previous vtable.
 *
 * Returned values:
 *   Returns the previous value of the prompt string.  This function may
 *   then be called with that value in order to restore the previous prompt.
 *
 * Assumptions:
 *   The prompt string is statically allocated a global.  readline() will
 *   simply remember the pointer to the string.  The string must stay
 *   allocated and available.  Only one prompt string is supported.  If
 *   there are multiple clients of readline(), they must all share the same
 *   prompt string (with exceptions in the case of the kernel build).

 * Name: readline_extmatch

 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   vtbl - Callbacks to access the external names.
 *
 * Returned values:
 *   Returns the previous vtable pointer.  This function may then be
 *   called with that value in order to restore the previous vtable.
 *
 * Assumptions:
 *   The vtbl string is statically allocated a global.  readline() will
 *   simply remember the pointer to the structure.  The structure must stay
 *   allocated and available.  Only one instance of such a structure is
 *   supported.  If there are multiple clients of readline(), they must all

/****************************************************************************
 * Name: readline
 *
 *   readline() reads in at most one less than 'buflen' characters from
 *   'instream' and stores them into the buffer pointed to by 'buf'.
 *   Characters are echoed on 'outstream'.  Reading stops after an EOF or a
 *   newline.  If a newline is read, it is stored into the buffer.  A null
 *   terminator is stored after the last character in the buffer.
 *
 *   This version of realine assumes that we are reading and writing to
 *   a VT100 console.  This will not work well if 'instream' or 'outstream'
 *   corresponds to a raw byte steam.
 *
 *   This function is inspired by the GNU readline but is an entirely
 *   different creature.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   buf       - The user allocated buffer to be filled.
 *   buflen    - the size of the buffer.
 *   instream  - The stream to read characters from
 *   outstream - The stream to each characters to.
 *
 * Returned values:
 *   On success, the (positive) number of bytes transferred is returned.
 *   EOF is returned to indicate either an end of file condition or a
 *   failure.
