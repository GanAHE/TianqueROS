 * Description:
 *   This interfaces maybe to called or started with task_start to start a

 *   function does not return.
 *
 *   This function handles generic /dev/console character devices for output
 *   but uses a special USB keyboard device for input.  The USB keyboard
 *   requires some special operations to handle the cases where the session
 *   input is lost when the USB keyboard is unplugged and restarted when the
 *   USB keyboard is plugged in again.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   Standard task start-up arguments.  These are not used.  argc may be
 *   zero and argv may be NULL.
 *
 * Returned Values:
 *   This function does not return nor does it ever exit (unless the user
 *   executes the NSH exit command).
