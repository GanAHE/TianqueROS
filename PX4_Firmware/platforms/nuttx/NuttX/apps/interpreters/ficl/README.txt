Build Instructions
------------------

Disclaimer:  This installation steps have only been exercised using Ficl
4.1.0.  With new versions you will likely have to make some adjustments
to this instructtions or to the files within this directory.  Think of this
information as "recommendations" -- not necessarily proven instructions.

1. CD to apps/interpreters/ficl

2. Download Ficl: http://sourceforge.net/projects/ficl/files/

3. Uznip the Ficl compressed file.

   For example, 'unzip ficl-4.1.0.zip' will leave the file
   apps/interpreters/ficl/ficl-4.1.0

4. Configure to build Ficl in the apps/interpreters/ficl directory using
   the configure.sh script.

   For example, './configure.sh ficl-4.1.0' will leave the Makefile
   fragment 'Make.srcs' in the ficl build directory.

5. Create your NuttX configuration.  Using the 'make menuconfig', you
   should select:

     CONFIG_INTERPRETERS_FICL=y

6. Configure and build NuttX.  On successful completion, the Ficl objects
   will be available in apps/libapps.a and that NuttX binary will be
   linked against that file.  Of course, Ficl will do nothing unless
   you have written some application code that uses it!
