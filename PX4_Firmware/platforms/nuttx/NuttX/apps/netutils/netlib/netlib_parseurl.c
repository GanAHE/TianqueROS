 * Name: netlib_parseurl
 *
 * Description:
 *   Parse an URL, not only HTTP ones. The parsing is according to this rule:
 *   SCHEME :// HOST [: PORT] / PATH
 *   - scheme is everything before the first colon
 *   - scheme must be followed by ://
 *   - host is everything until colon or slash
 *   - port is optional, parsed only if host ends with colon
 *   - path is everything after the host.
 *   This is noticeably simpler that the official URL parsing method, since
 *   - it does not take into account the user:pass@ part that can be present
 *     before the host. Support of these fields is planned in the url_s
 *     structure, but it is not parsed yet/
 *   - it does not separate the URL parameters nor the bookmark
 *   Note: see here for the documentation of a complete URL parsing routine:
 *   https://www.php.net/manual/fr/function.parse-url.php
