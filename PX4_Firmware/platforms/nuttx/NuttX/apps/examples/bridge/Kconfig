		Simple test of a system with multiple networks.  It simply echoes all
		UDP packets received on network 1 and network 2 to network 2 and
		network 1, respectively.  Interface 1 and interface may or may not
		lie on the same network.

		If used as a NSH add-on, then it is assumed that initialization of
		both networks was performed externally prior to the time that this
		test was started.
