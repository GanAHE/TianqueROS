nxwm
====

  This directory holds a tiny desktop for small embedded devices with a
  touchscreen,. NxWM.  NxWM is true multiple window manager but only one
  window is displayed at a time.  This simplification helps performance on
  LCD based products (in the same way that a tiled window manager helps)
  and also makes the best use of small displays.  It is awkward from a
  human factors point-of-view trying to manage multiple windows on a
  small display.

  The window manager consists of a task bar with icons representing the
  running tasks.  If you touch the task's icon, it comes to the top.  Each
  window has a toolbar with (1) a title, (2) a minimize button, and (3) a
  stop application button using the standard icons for these things.

  There is always a start window that is available in the task bar.  When
  you touch the start window icon, it brings up the start window containing
  icons representing all of the available applications.  If you touch an
  icon in the start window, it will be started and added to the task bar.

  There is a base class that defines an add-on application and an
  interface that supports incorporation of new application.  The only
  application that is provided is NxTerm.  This is an  NSH session
  running in a window.  You should be able to select the NX icon in the start
  menu and create as many NSH sessions in windows as you want. (keybard input
  still comes through serial).

  Note 1: NwWM requires NuttX-7.19 or above to work with the current
  NxWidgets-1.18 release.
