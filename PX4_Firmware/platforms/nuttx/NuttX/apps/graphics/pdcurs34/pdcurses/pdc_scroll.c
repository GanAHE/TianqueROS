/* Name: scroll
 *
 * Synopsis:
 *       int scroll(WINDOW *win);
 *       int scrl(int n);
 *       int wscrl(WINDOW *win, int n);
 *
 * Description:
 *       scroll() causes the window to scroll up one line.  This involves
 *       moving the lines in the window data strcture.
 *
 *       With a positive n, scrl() and wscrl() scroll the window up n
 *       lines (line i + n becomes i); otherwise they scroll the window
 *       down n lines.

 *       For these functions to work, scrolling must be enabled via
 *       scrollok(). Note also that scrolling is not allowed if the
 *       supplied window is a pad.
 *
 * Return Value:
 *       All functions return OK on success and ERR on error.
 *
 * Portability                                X/Open    BSD    SYS V
 *       scroll                                  Y       Y       Y
