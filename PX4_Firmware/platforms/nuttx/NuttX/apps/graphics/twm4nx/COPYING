The following is the full text of the COPYING file for TWM 1.0.10.  Twm4Nx
is largely an original development, but owes acknowledge to TWM for its
design base and thanks fot TWM for many years in the open source community.

This copyright notice is probably not necessary since Twm4Nx is not TWM,
but this assures that things are right.  See the top-level README.txt file
for additional information.
