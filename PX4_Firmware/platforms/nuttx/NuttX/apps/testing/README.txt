apps/testing README file
========================

  The apps/testing directory is used to build NuttX-specific tests and to
  include external testing frameworks.

  There is overlap between what you will find in apps/examples and apps/testing
  in the sense that there are also tests in apps/examples as well. Those
  tests, however, can also be used to illustrate usage of a NuttX feature.
  Most of the tests in apps/testing, on the other hand, are pure tests with
  little value as usage examples.

testing/cxxtest
===============

  This is a test of the C++ standard library.  At present a port of the uClibc++
  C++ library is available.  Due to licensing issues, the uClibc++ C++ library
  is not included in the NuttX source tree by default, but must be installed
  (see the README.txt file in the uClibc++ download package for installation).

  The uClibc++ test includes simple test of:

    - iostreams,
    - STL,
    - RTTI, and
    - Exceptions

  Example Configuration Options
  -----------------------------
    CONFIG_TESTING_CXXTEST=y - Eanbles the example
    CONFIG_TESTING_CXXTEST_CXXINITIALIZE=y - By default, if CONFIG_HAVE_CXX
      and CONFIG_HAVE_CXXINITIALIZE are defined, then this example
      will call the NuttX function to initialize static C++ constructors.
      This option may be disabled, however, if that static initialization
      was performed elsewhere.

  Other Required Configuration Settings
  -------------------------------------
  Other NuttX setting that are required include:

    CONFIG_HAVE_CXX=y
    CONFIG_HAVE_CXXINITIALIZE=y
    CONFIG_UCLIBCXX=y

  Additional uClibc++ settings may be required in your build environment.

testing/fstest
==============

  This is a generic file system test that derives from testing/nxffs.  It
  was created to test the tmpfs file system, but should work with any file
  system provided that all initialization has already been performed prior
  to starting the test.

  This test a a general test for any file system, but includes some specific
  hooks for the SPIFFS file system.

  * CONFIG_TESTING_FSTEST: Enable the file system example
  * CONFIG_TESTING_FSTEST_MAXNAME: Determines the maximum size of names used
    in the filesystem
  * CONFIG_TESTING_FSTEST_MAXFILE: Determines the maximum size of a file
  * CONFIG_TESTING_FSTEST_MAXIO: Max I/O, default 347.
  * CONFIG_TESTING_FSTEST_MAXOPEN: Max open files.
  * CONFIG_TESTING_FSTEST_MOUNTPT: Path where the file system is mounted.
  * CONFIG_TESTING_FSTEST_NLOOPS: Number of test loops. default 100
  * CONFIG_TESTING_FSTEST_VERBOSE: Verbose output

testing/nxffs
=============

  This is a test of the NuttX NXFFS FLASH file system.  This is an NXFFS
  stress test and beats on the file system very hard.  It should only
  be used in a simulation environment!  Putting this NXFFS test on real
  hardware will most likely destroy your FLASH.  You have been warned.

testing/ostest
==============

  This is the NuttX 'qualification' suite.  It attempts to exercise
  a broad set of OS functionality.  Its coverage is not very extensive
  as of this writing, but it is used to qualify each NuttX release.

  The behavior of the ostest can be modified with the following
  settings in the boards/<arch>/<chip>/<board>/configs/<config>/defconfig
  file:

  * CONFIG_NSH_BUILTIN_APPS
      Build the OS test example as an NSH built-in application.
  * CONFIG_TESTING_OSTEST_LOOPS
      Used to control the number of executions of the test.  If
      undefined, the test executes one time.  If defined to be
      zero, the test runs forever.
  * CONFIG_TESTING_OSTEST_STACKSIZE
      Used to create the ostest task.  Default is 8192.
  * CONFIG_TESTING_OSTEST_NBARRIER_THREADS
      Specifies the number of threads to create in the barrier
      test.  The default is 8 but a smaller number may be needed on
      systems without sufficient memory to start so many threads.
  * CONFIG_TESTING_OSTEST_RR_RANGE
      During round-robin scheduling test two threads are created. Each of the threads
      searches for prime numbers in the configurable range, doing that configurable
      number of times.
      This value specifies the end of search range and together with number of runs
      allows to configure the length of this test - it should last at least a few
      tens of seconds. Allowed values [1; 32767], default 10000
  * CONFIG_TESTING_OSTEST_RR_RUNS
      During round-robin scheduling test two threads are created. Each of the threads
      searches for prime numbers in the configurable range, doing that configurable
      number of times.

testing/smart
=============

  This is a test of the SMART file system that derives from
  testing/nxffs.

  * CONFIG_TESTING_SMART: - Enable the SMART file system example
  * CONFIG_TESTING_SMART_ARCHINIT: The default is to use the RAM MTD
    device at drivers/mtd/rammtd.c.  But an architecture-specific MTD
    driver can be used instead by defining CONFIG_TESTING_SMART_ARCHINIT.  In
    this case, the initialization logic will call smart_archinitialize()
    to obtain the MTD driver instance.
  * CONFIG_TESTING_SMART_NEBLOCKS: When CONFIG_TESTING_SMART_ARCHINIT is not
    defined, this test will use the RAM MTD device at drivers/mtd/rammtd.c
    to simulate FLASH.  In this case, this value must be provided to give
    the nubmer of erase blocks in MTD RAM device.  The size of the allocated
    RAM drive will be: CONFIG_RAMMTD_ERASESIZE * CONFIG_TESTING_SMART_NEBLOCKS
  * CONFIG_TESTING_SMART_MAXNAME: Determines the maximum size of names used
    in the filesystem
  * CONFIG_TESTING_SMART_MAXFILE: Determines the maximum size of a file
  * CONFIG_TESTING_SMART_MAXIO: Max I/O, default 347.
  * CONFIG_TESTING_SMART_MAXOPEN: Max open files.
  * CONFIG_TESTING_SMART_MOUNTPT: SMART mountpoint
  * CONFIG_TESTING_SMART_NLOOPS: Number of test loops. default 100
  * CONFIG_TESTING_SMART_VERBOSE: Verbose output

testing/smart_test
==================

  Performs a file-based test on a SMART (or any) filesystem. Validates
  seek, append and seek-with-write operations.

    * CONFIG_TESTING_SMART_TEST=y

    Source: NuttX
    Author: Ken Pettit
    Date: April 24, 2013

  Performs a file-based test on a SMART (or any) filesystem. Validates seek,
  append and seek-with-write operations.

  Usage:

    flash_test mtdblock_device

  Additional options:

    --force                     to replace existing installation

testing/smp
===========

  This is a simple test for SMP functionality.  It is basically just the
  pthread barrier test with some custom instrumentation.

testing/unity
=============

  Unity is a unit testing framework for C developed by ThrowTheSwitch.org:
