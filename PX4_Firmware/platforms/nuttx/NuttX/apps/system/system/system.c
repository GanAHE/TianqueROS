 * Name: system
 *
 * Description:
 *   Use system to pass a command string to the NSH parser and wait for it
 *   to finish executing.
 *
 *   This is an experimental version with known incompatibilities:
 *
 *   1. It is not a part of libc due to its close association with NSH.  The
 *      function is still prototyped in nuttx/include/stdlib.h, however.
 *   2. It cannot use /bin/sh since that program will not exist in most
 *      embedded configurations.  Rather, it will spawn a shell-specific
 *      system command -- currently only NSH.
 *   3. REVISIT: There may be some issues with returned values.
 *   4. Of course, only NSH commands will be supported so that still means
 *      that many leveraged system() calls will still not be functional.
 *
