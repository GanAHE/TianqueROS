======

  This directory provides support for the two-pass build.  Its primary
  purpose is to incorporate source logic generated by applications into the
  kernel phase of the build.

  In the two pass build, the application logic is built during the first
  phase, pass 1.  In that phase, the application may generate and install
  source files into the pass1/ directory.

  The operating system is built during phase 2 of the build.  At that time,
  those source files in the pass1/ directory will be built and incorporated
  into the kernel address space.

  The primary purpose of the pass1/ directory is to such application-
  generated kernel symbol tables.  For an example of the use of this
  feature, look at apps/examples/module/drivers/Makefile.  Kernel symbol
  tables are needed to support kernel modules.

  Of course, addition board-specific logic in, say, at
  boards/<arch>/<chip>/<board>/src would have to be included to make use of
  the application-installed symbol tables.
