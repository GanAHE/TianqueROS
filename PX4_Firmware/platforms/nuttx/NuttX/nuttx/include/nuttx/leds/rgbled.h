 * Name: rgbled_register
 *
 * Description:
 *   This function binds three instances of a "lower half" PWM driver with
 *   the "upper half" RGB LED device and registers that device so that can
 *   be used by application code.
 *
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   path - The full path to the driver to be registers in the NuttX pseudo-
 *     filesystem.  The recommended convention is to name all PWM drivers
 *     as "/dev/rgdbled0", "/dev/rgbled1", etc.  where the driver path
 *     differs only in the "minor" number at the end of the device name.
 *   ledr, ledg, and ledb - A pointer to an instance of lower half PWM
 *     drivers for the red, green, and blue LEDs, respectively.  These
 *     instances will be bound to the RGB LED driver and must persists as
 *     long as that driver persists.
 *   chanr, chang, chanb -Red/Green/Blue PWM channels (only if
 *     CONFIG_PWM_MULTICHAN is defined)
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   Zero on success; a negated errno value on failure.
