 * Name: find_blockdriver
 *
 * Description:
 *   Return the inode of the block driver specified by 'pathname'
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   pathname   - The full path to the block driver to be located
 *   mountflags - If MS_RDONLY is not set, then driver must support write
 *                operations (see include/sys/mount.h)
 *   ppinode    - Address of the location to return the inode reference
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   Returns zero on success or a negated errno on failure:
 *
 *   ENOENT  - No block driver of this name is registered
 *   ENOTBLK - The inode associated with the pathname is not a block driver
 *   EACCESS - The MS_RDONLY option was not set but this driver does not
 *             support write access
 *
