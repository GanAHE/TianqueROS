 * Name: nxffs_verifyblock
 *
 * Description:
 *   Assure that the provided (logical) block number is in the block cache
 *   and that it has a valid block header (i.e., proper magic and
 *   marked good)
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   volume - Describes the NXFFS volume
 *   block - The (logical) block number to load and verify.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   OK (zero( is returned on success.  Otherwise, a negated errno value is
 *   returned indicating the nature of the failure:
 *
 *     -EIO is returned if we failed to read the block.  If we are using
 *        NAND memory, then this probably means that the block has
 *        uncorrectable bit errors.
 *     -ENOENT is returned if the block is a bad block.
