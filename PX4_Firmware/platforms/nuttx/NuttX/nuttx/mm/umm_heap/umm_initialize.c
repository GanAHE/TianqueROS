 * Name: umm_initialize
 *
 * Description:
 *   This is a simple wrapper for the mm_initialize() function.  This
 *   function will initialize the user heap.
 *
 *   CONFIG_BUILD_FLAT:
 *     There is only kernel mode "blob" containing both kernel and
 *     application code.  There is only one heap that is used by both the
 *     kernel and application logic.
 *
 *     In this configuration, this function is called early in nx_start()
 *     to initialize the common heap.
 *
 *   CONFIG_BUILD_PROTECTED
 *     In this configuration, there are two "blobs", one containing
 *     protected kernel logic and one containing unprotected application
 *     logic.  Depending upon the setting of CONFIG_MM_KERNEL_HEAP there
 *     may be only a single shared heap, much as with CONFIG_BUILD_FLAT.
 *     Or there may be separate protected/kernel and unprotected/user
 *     heaps.
 *
 *     In either case, this function is still called early in nx_start()
 *     to initialize the user heap.
 *
 *   CONFIG_BUILD_KERNEL
 *     In this configuration there are multiple user heaps, one for each
 *     user process.  Furthermore, each heap is initially empty; memory
 *     is added to each heap dynamically via sbrk().  The heap data
 *     structure was set to zero when the address environment was created.
 *     Otherwise, the heap is uninitialized.
 *
 *     This function is not called at all.  Rather, this function is called
 *     when each user process is created before the first allocation is made.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   heap_start - Address of the beginning of the (initial) memory region
 *   heap_size  - The size (in bytes) if the (initial) memory region.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   None
