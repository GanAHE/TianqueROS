 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   conn - UDP connection structure (not currently used).

 * Returned Value:
 *   A reference to the bound device.  If the retained interface index no
 *   longer refers to a valid device, this function will unbind the device
 *   and return an arbitrary network device at the head of the list of
 *   registered devices.  This supports legacy IPv4 DHCPD behavior when
 *   there is only a single registered network device.
