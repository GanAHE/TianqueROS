# Description:
#   -----------
#   Scenario #1
#   -----------
#   This utility was developed by RidgeRun for the
#   purpose of converting a standard binary executable
#   image (such as ELF) into a special format (RR
#   format) suitable for quick downloads to the target
#   TI925 RidgeRun Bootloader (rrload). The image is
#   produced by constructing a special header which is
#   then tacked onto the front of the supplied binary
#   image.  The resulting binary image is smaller than
#   what would normally be encountered with traditional
#   download formats (such as SREC or uuencoded; both
#   ascii based). The special header at the front of the
#   image is used to guide the target's rrload (a
#   booloader developed by RidgeRun Inc). The header
#   data contains a field representing the total byte
#   count of the binary data following the header as
#   well as a field that indicates the load address of
#   run image. Additionally, a field exists in the
#   header which indicates the image's entry point which
#   could be called by the bootloader to invoked the
#   just downloaded program.
#   -----------
#   Scenario #2
#   -----------
#   If the supplied image is not a standard binary
#   executagle image then that is ok too, a header is
#   constructed and tacked onto the front of the supplied
#   binary data forming the new binary image (in rr format).
#   In this case the EntryAddr is set to 0xFFFFFFFF by
#   default and the LoadAddr is set to   0x00000000 by
#   default unless otherwise indicated by command line
#   arguments -LEntry and -LAddr which if used are assumed
#   to be in hexidecimal units.
#
#   -----------
#   Scenario #3
#   -----------
#
#   Read/Write file system (like JFFS) that will not
#   work if rrload stores a 20 byte header at the beginning
#   of the flashed component image
#
#   mkimage [--NoHeader ] <input-bin> <out-RR>
#
# Usage:
#   mkimage [--LAddr h] [--EAddr h] [--NoHeader] <input-bin> <out-RR>
#
# Examples:
#   $ mkimage linux linux.rr
#     ..or..
#   $ mkimage -LAddr 10008000 -EAddr 10008000 vmlinux vmlinux.rr
#     ..or..
#   $ mkimage --NoHeader fileSys.gz fileSys.gz.rr
#     ..or..
#   $ mkimage --LAddr A00 fileSys.gz fileSys.gz.rr
#     ..or..
#   $ mkimage --LAddr A00 fileSys.gz fileSys.gz.rr
#                     ^
#                     |
#                 Assumed hex units.
#                 Please omit the
#                 leading "0x".
