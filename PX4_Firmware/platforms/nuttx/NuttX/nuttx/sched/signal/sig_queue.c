 * Name: nxsig_queue
 *
 * Description:
 *   This function sends the signal specified by signo with the signal
 *   parameter value to the process specified by pid.
 *
 *   If the receiving process has the signal blocked via the sigprocmask,
 *   the signal will pend until it is unmasked. Only one pending signal (per
 *   signo) is retained.  This is consistent with POSIX which states, "If
 *   a subsequent occurrence of a pending signal is generated, it is
 *   implementation defined as to whether the signal is delivered more than
 *   once.
 *
 *   This is an internal OS interface.  It is functionally equivalent to
 *   sigqueue() except that it does not modify the errno value.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   pid - Process ID of task to receive signal
 *   signo - Signal number
 *   value - Value to pass to task with signal
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   This is an internal OS interface and should not be used by applications.
 *   It follows the NuttX internal error return policy:  Zero (OK) is
 *   returned on success.  A negated errno value is returned on failure.
 *
 *    EGAIN  - The limit of signals which may be queued has been reached.
 *    EINVAL - sig was invalid.
 *    EPERM  - The  process  does  not  have  permission to send the
 *             signal to the receiving process.
 *    ESRCH  - No process has a PID matching pid.
