 * Name: wd_delete
 *
 * Description:
 *   The wd_delete() function will deallocate a watchdog timer by returning
 *   it to the free pool of watchdog timers.  The watchdog timer will be
 *   removed from the active timer queue if had been started.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   wdog - The watchdog ID to delete.  This is actually a pointer to a
 *          watchdog structure.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   Zero (OK) is returned on success; a negated errno value is return to
 *   indicate the nature of any failure.
 *
 * Assumptions:
 *   The caller has assured that the watchdog is no longer in use.
 *
