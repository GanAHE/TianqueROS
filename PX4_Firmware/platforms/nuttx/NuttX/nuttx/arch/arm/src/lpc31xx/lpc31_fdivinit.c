 * Name: lpc31_bitwidth
 *
 * Description:
 *   Find the bit width of a msub or madd value.  This will be use to
 *   extend the msub or madd values.  To minimize power consumption, the
 *   lpc313x user manual recommends that madd and msub be shifted right
 *   to have as many trailing zero's as possible.  This function detmines
 *   the pre-shifted with of one of the msub or madd values.
 *
 * EXAMPLE:
 *
 *  Say an input frequency of 13 MHz is given while a frequency of 12
 *  MHz is required. In this case we want a frequency
 *
 *    f’ = 12/13 × f
 *
 *  So n = 12 and m = 13. This then gives
 *
 *    madd = m - n = 13 - 12 = 1
 *    msub = -n = -12
 *
 * In order to minimize power consumption madd and msub must be as
 * large as possible. The limit of their values is determined by the
 * madd/msub bit width. In this case msub is the largest value,
 * in order to express -12, five bits are required. However since msub is
 * always negative the fractional divider does not need the sign bit, leaving
 * 4 bits. If madd/msub bit width has been set to say 8 bits, it is allowed
 * to shift 4 bits, giving:
 *
 *   msub’ = -(12<<4)= -12 × 24 = -12 × 16 = -192
 *   madd’ = 1<<4 = 24 = 16
