 * Name: sim_smp_hook
 *
 * Description:
 *   This is a mindless little hook between sim_idle_trampoline() and the
 *   real IDLE task logic.  This is only needed because we need to access
 *   elements of the TCB in the simulation domain but sim_idle_trampoline()
 *   lies in the host domain.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   None
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   None (should not return)
 *
