 * Tickless OS Support.
 *
 * When CONFIG_SCHED_TICKLESS is enabled, all support for timer interrupts
 * is suppressed and the platform specific code is expected to provide the
 * following custom functions.
 *
 *   void sim_timer_initialize(void): Initializes the timer facilities.
 *     Called early in the initialization sequence (by up_initialize()).
 *   int up_timer_gettime(FAR struct timespec *ts):  Returns the current
 *     time from the platform specific time source.
 *   int up_timer_cancel(void):  Cancels the interval timer.
 *   int up_timer_start(FAR const struct timespec *ts): Start (or re-starts)
 *     the interval timer.
 *
 * The RTOS will provide the following interfaces for use by the platform-
 * specific interval timer implementation:
 *
 *   void nxsched_timer_expiration(void):  Called by the platform-specific
 *     logic when the interval timer expires.

/****************************************************************************
 * Name: sim_timer_initialize
 *
 * Description:
 *   Initializes all platform-specific timer facilities.  This function is
 *   called early in the initialization sequence by up_initialize().
 *   On return, the current up-time should be available from
 *   up_timer_gettime() and the interval timer is ready for use (but not
 *   actively timing.
 *
 *   Provided by platform-specific code and called from the architecture-
 *   specific logic.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   None
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   None
 *
 * Assumptions:
 *   Called early in the initialization sequence before any special
 *   concurrency protections are required.

/****************************************************************************
 * Name: up_timer_gettime
 *
 * Description:
 *   Return the elapsed time since power-up (or, more correctly, since
 *   sim_timer_initialize() was called).  This function is functionally
 *   equivalent to:
 *
 *      int clock_gettime(clockid_t clockid, FAR struct timespec *ts);
 *
 *   when clockid is CLOCK_MONOTONIC.
 *
 *   This function provides the basis for reporting the current time and
 *   also is used to eliminate error build-up from small erros in interval
 *   time calculations.
 *
 *   Provided by platform-specific code and called from the RTOS base code.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   ts - Provides the location in which to return the up-time.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   Zero (OK) is returned on success; a negated errno value is returned on
 *   any failure.
 *
 * Assumptions:
 *   Called from the normal tasking context.  The implementation must
 *   provide whatever mutual exclusion is necessary for correct operation.
 *   This can include disabling interrupts in order to assure atomic register
 *   operations.

/****************************************************************************
 * Name: up_timer_cancel
 *
 * Description:
 *   Cancel the interval timer and return the time remaining on the timer.
 *   These two steps need to be as nearly atomic as possible.
 *   nxsched_timer_expiration() will not be called unless the timer is
 *   restarted with up_timer_start().
 *
 *   If, as a race condition, the timer has already expired when this
 *   function is called, then that pending interrupt must be cleared so
 *   that up_timer_start() and the remaining time of zero should be
 *   returned.
 *
 *   Provided by platform-specific code and called from the RTOS base code.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   ts - Location to return the remaining time.  Zero should be returned
 *        if the timer is not active.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   Zero (OK) is returned on success; a negated errno value is returned on
 *   any failure.
 *
 * Assumptions:
 *   May be called from interrupt level handling or from the normal tasking
 *   level.  Interrupts may need to be disabled internally to assure
 *   non-reentrancy.
