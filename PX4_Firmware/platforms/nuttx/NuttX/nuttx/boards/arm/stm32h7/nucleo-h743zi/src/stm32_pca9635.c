 * Name: stm32_pca9635_initialize
 *
 * Description:
 *   This function is called by board initialization logic to configure the
 *   LED PWM chip.  This function will register the driver as /dev/leddrv0.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   None
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   Zero is returned on success.  Otherwise, a negated errno value is
 *   returned to indicate the nature of the failure.
