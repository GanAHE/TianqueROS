	---help---
		Automatically initialize the AT24 SPI EEPROM driver when NSH starts.

		The Serial EEPROM was mounted on an external adaptor board and
		connected to the LaunchPad thusly:

		- VCC -- VCC
		- GND -- GND
		- PB2 -- SCL
		- PB3  -- SDA

config TM4C123G_LAUNCHPAD_AT24_FTL
	bool "Create AT24 block driver"
	---help---
		Create the MTD driver for the AT24 and "wrap" the AT24 as a standard
		block driver that could then, for example, be mounted using FAT or
		any other file system.  Any file system may be used, but there will
		be no wear-leveling.

config TM4C123G_LAUNCHPAD_AT24_NXFFS
	bool "Create AT24 NXFFS file system"
	depends on FS_NXFFS
	---help---
		Create the MTD driver for the AT24 and mount the AT24 device as
		a wear-leveling, NuttX FLASH file system (NXFFS).  The downside of
		NXFFS is that it can be very slow.
