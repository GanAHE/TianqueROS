/* There is one user accessible LED status indicator located on the 1020-EVK.
 * The function of the LEDs include:
 *
 * D3: Power (Green) & Overpower (Red)
 * D5: User LED (Green) GPIO_AD_B0_05
 * D15: RST LED (Red)
 *
 * This LED is not used by the board port unless CONFIG_ARCH_LEDS is
 * defined.  In that case, the usage by the board port is defined in
 * include/board.h and src/imxrt_autoleds.c. The LED is used to encode
 * OS-related events as documented in board.h
 *
 * The intention is that if the LED is statically on, NuttX has successfully
 * booted and is, apparently, running normally.  If the LED is flashing at
 * approximately 2Hz, then a fatal error has been detected and the system has
 * halted.
