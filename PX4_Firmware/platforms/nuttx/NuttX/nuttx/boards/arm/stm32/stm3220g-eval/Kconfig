config STM3220G_LCD
	bool "Select support for the STM3210E-EVAL LCD"
	default y
	depends on LCD && STM32_FSMC
	---help---
		Enable support for the LCD on the STM3220G-EVAL board.  See additional,
		LCD-common settings in the drivers/lcd Kconfig file.

config LCD_RDSHIFT
	int "LCD data shift"
	default 5
	depends on STM3220G_LCD
	---help---
		When reading 16-bit gram data, there appears to be a shift in the returned
		data.  This value fixes the offset.  Default 5.

config STM32_ILI9320_DISABLE
	bool "Disable LCD_ILI9320 (and LCD_ILI9321) support"
	default n
	depends on STM3220G_LCD
	---help---
		The LCD driver dynamically selects the LCD based on the reported LCD
		ID value.  However, code size can be reduced by suppressing support for
		individual LCDs using this option.

config STM32_ILI9325_DISABLE
	bool "Disable LCD_ILI9325 support"
	default n
	depends on STM3220G_LCD
	---help---
		The LCD driver dynamically selects the LCD based on the reported LCD
		ID value.  However, code size can be reduced by suppressing support for
		individual LCDs using this option
