 * Name: Abort
 *
 * Description:
 *   The abort() first unblocks the SIGABRT signal, and then raises that
 *   signal for the calling process. This results in the abnormal
 *   termination of the process unless the SIGABRT signal is caught and
 *   the signal handler does not return.
 *
 *   If the abort() function causes process termination, all open
 *   streams are closed and flushed.
 *
 *   If the SIGABRT signal is ignored, or caught by a handler that
 *   returns, the abort() function will still terminate the process.
 *   It does this by restoring the default disposition for SIGABRT and
 *   then raising the signal for a second time.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   None
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *  This function does not return,
 *
 ****************************************************************************/

void abort(void)
{
  /* NuttX does not support standard signal functionality (like the
   * behavior of the SIGABRT signal).  So no attempt is made to provide
   * a conformant version of abort() at this time.  This version does not
   * signal the calling thread all.
   *
   * Note that pthread_exit() is called instead of exit().  That is because
   * we do no know if abort was called from a pthread or a normal thread
   * (we could find out, of course).  If abort() is called from a non-pthread,
   * then pthread_exit() should fail and fall back to call exit() anyway.
   *
   * If exit() is called (either below or via pthread_exit()), then exit()
   * will flush and close all open files and terminate the thread.  If this
   * function was called from a pthread, then pthread_exit() will complete
   * any joins, but will not flush or close any streams.
