 * Name: usub64x32
 *
 * Description:
 *   Subtract a 32-bit value from a 64-bit value and return the 64-bit
 *   difference.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   minuend    - The number from which another number (the Subtrahend) is
 *     to be subtracted.
 *   subtrahend - The number that is to be subtracted.
 *   difference - The location to return the difference of the two values.
 *     difference may the same as one of minuend or subtrahend.
 *
