 * Name: memchr
 *
 * Description:
 *   The memchr() function locates the first occurrence of 'c' (converted to
 *   an unsigned char) in the initial 'n' bytes (each interpreted as
 *   unsigned char) of the object pointed to by s.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   The memchr() function returns a pointer to the located byte, or a null
 *   pointer if the byte does not occur in the object.
