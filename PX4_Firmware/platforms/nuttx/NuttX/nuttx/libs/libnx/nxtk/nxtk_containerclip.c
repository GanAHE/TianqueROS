 * Name: nxtk_containerclip
 *
 * Description:
 *   We are given a 'src' rectangle in containing window, relative coordinates
 *   (i.e., (0,0) is the top left corner of the outer, containing window).
 *   This function will (1) clip that src rectangle so that it lies within
 *   the sub-window bounds, and then (2) move the rectangle to that it is
 *   relative to the sub-window (i.e., (0,0) is the top left corner of the
 *   sub-window).
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   fwnd   - The framed window to be used
 *   dest   - The locaton to put the result
 *   src    - The src rectangle in relative container-window coordinates
 *   bounds - The subwindow bounds in absolute screen coordinates.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   None
