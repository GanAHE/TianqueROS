 * Name: nxtk_bitmapwindow
 *
 * Description:
 *   Copy a rectangular region of a larger image into the rectangle in the
 *   specified client sub-window.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   hfwnd    The client sub0window that will receive the bitmap image
 *   dest   - Describes the rectangular region on in the client sub-window
 *            will receive the bit map.
 *   src    - The start of the source image.
 *   origin - The origin of the upper, left-most corner of the full bitmap.
 *            Both dest and origin are in sub-window coordinates, however, the
 *            origin may lie outside of the sub-window display.
 *   stride - The width of the full source image in pixels.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   OK on success; ERROR on failure with errno set appropriately
 *
