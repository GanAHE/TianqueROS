 * Name: nxtk_getwindow
 *
 * Description:
 *  Get the raw contents of graphic memory within a rectangular region. NOTE:
 *  Since raw graphic memory is returned, the returned memory content may be
 *  the memory of windows above this one and may not necessarily belong to
 *  this window unless you assure that this is the top window.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   wnd  - The window structure reference
 *   rect - The location to be copied
 *   plane - Specifies the color plane to get from.
 *   dest - The location to copy the memory region
 *   deststride - The width, in bytes, of the dest memory
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   OK on success; ERROR on failure with errno set appropriately
 *
