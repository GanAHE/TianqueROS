 * Name: nxtk_setposition
 *
 * Description:
 *  Set the position for the selected client window.  This position does not
 *  include the offsets for the borders nor for any toolbar.  Those offsets
 *  will be added in to set the full window position.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   hfwnd - The window handle returned by nxtk_openwindow
 *   pos   - The new position of the client sub-window
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   OK on success; ERROR on failure with errno set appropriately
 *
