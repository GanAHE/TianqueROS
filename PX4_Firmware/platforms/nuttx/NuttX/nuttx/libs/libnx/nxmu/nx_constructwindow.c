 * Name: nx_constructwindow
 *
 * Description:
 *   This function is the same a nx_openwindow EXCEPT that the client provides
 *   the window structure instance.  nx_constructwindow will initialize the
 *   the pre-allocated window structure for use by NX.  This function is
 *   provided in addition to nx_openwindow in order to support a kind of
 *   inheritance:  The caller's window structure may include extensions that
 *   are not visible to NX.
 *
 *   NOTE:  hwnd must have been allocated using a user-space allocator that
 *   permits user access to the window.  Once provided to nx_constructwindow()
 *   that memory is owned and managed by NX.  On certain error conditions or
 *   when the window is closed, NX will free the window.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   handle - The handle returned by nx_connect
 *   hwnd   - The pre-allocated window structure.
 *   flags  - Optional flags.  Must be zero unless CONFIG_NX_RAMBACKED is
 *            enabled.  In that case, it may be zero or
 *            NXBE_WINDOW_RAMBACKED
 *   cb     - Callbacks used to process window events
 *   arg    - User provided value that will be returned with NX callbacks.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   OK on success; ERROR on failure with errno set appropriately.  In the
 *   case of ERROR, NX will have deallocated the pre-allocated window.
