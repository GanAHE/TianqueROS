/* Historically PX4 used one ADC1 With FMUvnX this has changes.
 * These defines maintain compatibility while allowing the
 * new boards to override the ADC used from HW VER/REV and
 * the system one.
 *
 * Depending on HW configuration (VER/REV POP options) hardware detection
 * may or may NOT initialize a given ADC. SYSTEM_ADC_COUNT is used to size the
 * singleton array to ensure this is only done once per ADC.
